## Plans for future updates
- Change Queen's functionallity to Draw 2
- Make it so Jack becomes reverse/skip depending on player choice and number of people
- If possible, somehow implement multiplayer in addition to play against CPU
- Make it possible for deck to be reshuffled
- Animations where possible
